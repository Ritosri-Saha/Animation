        <h1>Knowledge:</h1>
        <h3>Atomic motion, as studied in physics and chemistry, encompasses various types of movement at the atomic level.
            These include translational motion (movement from one point to another), 
            vibrational motion (atoms wiggling within a molecule), and the motion of electrons within and around the atom.
            Additionally, the concept of Brownian motion describes the seemingly random movement of particles suspended in a fluid,
            which is caused by the bombardment of the particles by much smaller molecules.
